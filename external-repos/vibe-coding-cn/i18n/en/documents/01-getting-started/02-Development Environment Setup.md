## 🪟 Windows User Prompts

### Option A: WSL2 + Linux Environment (Recommended)

> Suitable for: Users who want a complete Linux development experience with the best compatibility

```
You are a patient development environment setup assistant. I am a complete novice using a Windows system, and I need you to guide me step-by-step through setting up a Linux development environment via WSL2.

Please guide me in the following order, giving me only one step at a time, and waiting for my confirmation before proceeding to the next:

1. Install WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
2. Install Ubuntu in WSL2
3. Configure the basic Ubuntu environment (update the system)
4. Install nvm and Node.js
5. Install Gemini CLI or other free AI CLI tools
6. Install basic development tools (git, python, build-essential, tmux)
7. Configure Git user information
8. Install a code editor (VS Code and configure the WSL extension)
9. Verify that all tools are working correctly

Requirements:
- For each step, provide specific commands and tell me where to run them (PowerShell or Ubuntu terminal).
- Explain the purpose of each command in simple, easy-to-understand language.
- If I encounter an error, help me analyze the cause and provide a solution.
- After completing each step, ask me if it was successful before continuing to the next.

Now, let's start with the first step.
```

### Option B: Windows Native Terminal

> Suitable for: Users who don't want to install WSL and develop directly on Windows

```
You are a patient development environment setup assistant. I am a complete novice using a Windows system, and I need you to guide me step-by-step through setting up a development environment in a native Windows environment (without using WSL).

Please guide me in the following order, giving me only one step at a time, and waiting for my confirmation before proceeding to the next:

1. Install Windows Terminal (if not already installed)
2. Install Node.js (via official installer or winget)
3. Install Git for Windows

## After Configuration

### CLI Tool Configuration Tips

AI CLI tools typically ask for confirmation by default; enabling full permission mode can skip this:

```bash
# Codex - Most powerful configuration
codex --enable web_search_request -m gpt-5.1-codex-max -c model_reasoning_effort="high" --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox

# Claude Code - Skip all confirmations
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Gemini CLI - YOLO mode
gemini --yolo
```

### Recommended Bash Alias Configuration

Add the following configuration to `~/.bashrc` to launch AI with a single letter:

```bash
# c - Codex (GPT-5.1 most powerful mode)
alias c='codex --enable web_search_request -m gpt-5.1-codex-max -c model_reasoning_effort="high" --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox'

# cc - Claude Code (full permissions)
alias cc='claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'

# g - Gemini CLI (YOLO mode)
alias g='gemini --yolo'
```

After configuration, execute `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.
